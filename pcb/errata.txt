v1.0 First board sent for fabrication
=====================================

Wrong footprint for the Spectrum edge connector. I used
zxbus:ZX_Bus_Pin_Header, which is two rows of pin headers about
2.5mm apart. They should be 5mm apart.

In my previous projects I appear to have modified the footprint
myself. I only vaguely remember doing it, but I think I did. I
didn't copy that footprint out to this project, I used the one
from the library which is too small.

Further, the holes are too small. They were a tight fit previously
but I've bought 200 header rows from China and it appears their pins
are very slightly larger and they don't fit in the holes.

I think the solution is to use zxedge:Spectrum_Edge_Connector, which is
the correctly spaced footprint, which larger holes. I can't remember
where I got this library from, so it's another punt.
:: Fixed



I forgot the label in the silkscreen. Need to add a v1.1 to the next one.
:: Fixed



Break the signals which would do damage to the Pico out to another
connector header, so they aren't so easy to get wrong. +5V, -5V, +9V and
+12V are the obvious ones. There might be others.
:: Fixed, I move them to the end of the connector and marked them 
   in the silk screen



Wire /INT up to GPIO15 on Pico1. I have the test for this and it
correctly sees 50Hz.
:: Done



Wire /CLK up to GPIO14 on Pico1. Tests for contended and noncontended
frquencies are in place.
:: Done



Wire up ZXHALT to GPIO13 on Pico1. Will reveal if Z80 is stuck in a
HALT lock (Z80 has execute HALT with interrupts disabled).
:: Decided against, low value test. HALT is on the socket connector



Wire up ZXNMI to GPIO12 on Pico1. Will reveal if Z80 is stuck with
incoming NMIs.
:: Decided against, low value test. NMI is on the socket connector



Wire up ZXM1 to GPIO11 on Pico1. Will reveal if Z80 is one with broken M1.
:: Done



v1.1 Second board, has the correct edge connector footprint
===========================================================

Missing off /IORQ was a mistake. Need to find a way to get
that back.


I'm only using a single input button. Remove the other, reclaim
the GPIO.
: To be confirmed.

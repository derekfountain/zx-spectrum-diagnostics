v1.0 First board sent for fabrication
=====================================

Wrong footprint for the Spectrum edge connector. I used
zxbus:ZX_Bus_Pin_Header, which is two rows of pin headers about
2.5mm apart. They should be 5mm apart.

In my previous projects I appear to have modified the footprint
myself. I only vaguely remember doing it, but I think I did. I
didn't copy that footprint out to this project, I used the one
from the library which is too small.

Further, the holes are too small. They were a tight fit previously
but I've bought 200 header rows from China and it appears their pins
are very slightly larger and they don't fit in the holes.

I think the solution is to use zxedge:Spectrum_Edge_Connector, which is
the correctly spaced footprint, which larger holes. I can't remember
where I got this library from, so it's another punt.
:: Fixed, but needs checking on the 1.1 board



I forgot the label in the silkscreen. Need to add a v1.1 to the next one.
:: Fixed



Break the signals which would do damage to the Pico out to another
connector header, so they aren't so easy to get wrong. +5V, -5V, +9V and
+12V are the obvious ones. There might be others.



Wire /INT up to GPIO15 on Pico1. I have the test for this and it
correctly sees 50Hz.
:: Done



Wire /CLK up to GPIO14 on Pico1. Tests for contended and noncontended
frquencies are in place.
:: Done



Wire up ZXHALT to GPIO13 on Pico1. Will reveal if Z80 is stuck in a
HALT lock (Z80 has execute HALT with interrupts disabled).



Wire up ZXNMI to GPIO12 on Pico1. Will reveal if Z80 is stuck with
incoming NMIs.



Wire up ZXM1 to GPIO11 on Pico1. Will reveal if Z80 is one with broken M1.

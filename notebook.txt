AM says I can measure the -5V rail with

             |         
             |         
  -5V--------+----------

If I know 5V then 


V(-5) = 2*V(measured) - V(5)

Example:

+5V is 5.00
-5V is -1.00

That's 3V dropped across each resistor (6V dropped in total).
So 3V dropped across R1.
Measured voltage will be 5.00-3.00=2.00

V(-5) = 2*2.00 - 5.00

V(-5) = 4-5 = -1

So it seems to work.

It makes sense. V(measured) is the voltage across one resistor, so
if the resistors are the same then double that is the voltage across
both resistors, which is +5V to -5V.

AM added that a diode is needed to protect it in case -5V is there
but +5 isn't. And another for the positive side.

             |      D2 
             |      |  
             +---------- V(measured)
             |      |  
             |     D1  
                    |  
            R2     GND 
                       
             |         
             |         
  -5V--------+----------

In this case, with +5V at 0V, without D2 there's a potential difference
between the Pico pin (set as input) and the -5V rail, so 
current would follow out of the Pico to -5V. That would probably
not do the Pico any good, so the diode will stop it. The current would
flow from GND, through D1 and R2, to -5V.

If -5V were to fail, but +5V remained (assume a broken track or something)
then 5V would flow through R1, and 1V8 would flow to the 3V3 rail via D2.
That would put 3V3 into the Pico's ADC.

Forward voltage of 1N4148 is 0.72V so that needs to be taken
into account, somehow.


 Extra note, though. On the Spectrum the 5V comes from the 7805, and
 isn't particularly precise. I have 4.85V on one of mine, and the -5V
 circuit is generating -5.01V. Which means there's 9.86V across the
 whole divider and the centre point is at 4.93V. Subtracting 5V from
 that results in -0.07V. That's what's going into the ADC, which
 reads it at zero, hence the final output value is an unmoving -5.000V.
 One of my boards has a measured -0.270V at the divider mid-point.

 Since the only 5V I have is actually from the system under test, I'm
 going to change the top of the divider to the 3V3 from the Pico, which
 is much more precise. I'll need to tweak the divider to keep it
 balanced.

 Further, the Pico pad can only tolerate a minimum of -0.5V, so I need
 to be careful. The clamping diodes would typically have a forward
 voltage of 0.7V so I could end up with -0.7V going into the Pico.
 I'll change the diodes to schottky ones. The lower VF should keep
 that clamped voltage at a minimum of -0.3V to -0.5V.
